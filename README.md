# Artisan Dynamic Data Pull
A [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) implementation of the Dynamic Data Pull (DDP) service for [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/). 

Dynamic Data Pull (DDP) is a special feature for importing data into REDCap from an external source system. It provides an adjudication process whereby REDCap users can approve all incoming data from the source system before it is officially saved in their REDCap project.

### Planned Features
- Data, Metadata, and User Access capabilities
- Support for database (MySQL, SQL Server, DB2, and PostgresSQL) and web service data retrieval
- An administration portal to manage your data sources and REDCap project metadata
